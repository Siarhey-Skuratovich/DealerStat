# DealerStat
## *Implemented without using Spring Boot features*
## Project description:
The project goal is to give an independent assessment to gameobject dealers (CS:GO, Fifa, Dota, Team Fortress, etc).
The rating is based on the reviews that can leave everyone under the selling post.
At the same time every post and comment go through the admin approvement.
## Behavior scenarios:
1) A trader comes to the site, fills out a questionnaire to create his page on
site. The administrator checks the information, makes an approval or declination
2) A registered user visits the site, sees the trader's post, leaves review.
The administrator checks the review, makes an approval or decline.
3) A registered user visits the site and does NOT see the trader's selling post to whom he wants to leave a review. Additional fields are added to his review, in which he creates a trader's selling post based on the information he has collected with his own hand. Administrator checks the review, makes an approval or decline.
